Modes for opening a file.

r - open for reading
w - open for writing
a - open for appending
+ - open for updating  --> works for reading and writing. 

'rt' --> this means that we are opening and reading text file. 
         We don't need to insert t for text files, by defualt it takes it.

'rb' --> this means that we are opening and reading binary file. 
         Whenever we work on binary file, we need to use b with read mode.
