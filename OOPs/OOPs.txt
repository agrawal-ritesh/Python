Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects

In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes 
in programming. 
It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. 
in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that 
together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

In simple terms - Solving a problem by creating a class and object.
