#List in python are the containers to store the value of any data type

a = [2,5,33,454,232,2,22,1]
print (a)


#now if I want to select any particular number from this array then it will be...
a = [3,22,2444,3232,11,2,332,1, "Ritesh", 66.65]
print (a)
print (a[0])
print (a[4])
print(a[8])  #In this we can use the basic list
